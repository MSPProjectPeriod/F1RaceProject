# F1RaceProject
The Repository for the Project Period June 2025.
Using the dataset given from https://github.com/toUpperCase78/formula1-datasets


https://docs.fastf1.dev/

We will be analysing Tire degradation using the correlation between laps, laptime and pit stops. Using Season 2024, Imola, Max Verstappen as first example.


FINAL CODE:

the optimization function instead of computing all the possible racing times. it tries to find the stratagy with the most tire useage possible for a stratgy. this is because in theory the more used out the tire the faster it goes. To ensure other options are also cconfirmed once the shortest theoretical max tire life of all the tires in a race is found. the programme will run through other configurations in different modes and with different tires to ensure other options arent missed. 

the programme sccored better on a different version where the driving style ("mode") wasnt taken into account. but this has been added and can be changed later 



HOW TO RUN:

1.Run input.py code
2. select race (1-24) --> press enter for default (bahrain 2024)
3. select if download file or look at already loaded files --> press enter for default (load prelouded files)
4. programme will output cav file with needed informaiton 

5. run optimization_function.py --> press enter for the defualts (first csv file and average values)
5.5. you can also select the driver
